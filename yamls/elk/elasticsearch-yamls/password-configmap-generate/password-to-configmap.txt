Generate a password and store in a k8s secret
We enabled the xpack security module to secure our cluster, so we need to initialise the passwords. 
Execute the following command which runs the program bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords within 
the client node container (any node would work) to generate default users and passwords.

Steps:

$ kubectl exec $(kubectl get pods -n monitoring | grep elasticsearch-client | sed -n 1p | awk '{print $1}') \
    -n monitoring \
    -- bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords auto -b

Changed password for user apm_system
PASSWORD apm_system = uF8k2KVwNokmHUomemBG

Changed password for user kibana
PASSWORD kibana = DBptcLh8hu26230mIYc3

Changed password for user logstash_system
PASSWORD logstash_system = SJFKuXncpNrkuSmVCaVS

Changed password for user beats_system
PASSWORD beats_system = FGgIkQ1ki7mPPB3d7ns7

Changed password for user remote_monitoring_user
PASSWORD remote_monitoring_user = EgFB3FOsORqOx2EuZNLZ

Changed password for user elastic
PASSWORD elastic = 3JW4tPdspoUHzQsfQyAI


Note the elastic user password and add it into a k8s secret like this:

$ kubectl create secret generic elasticsearch-pw-elastic \
    -n monitoring \
    --from-literal password=3JW4tPdspoUHzQsfQyAI
