After a couple of minutes, each node of the cluster should reconcile and the master node 
should log the following sentence Cluster health status changed from [YELLOW] to [GREEN].

Call below commands to check status:

$ kubectl logs -f -n monitoring \
  $(kubectl get pods -n monitoring | grep elasticsearch-master | sed -n 1p | awk '{print $1}') \
  | grep "Cluster health status changed from \[YELLOW\] to \[GREEN\]"
